Design comprehensive architecture for: $ARGUMENTS

<ultrathink>
Think deeply. Consider everything. This design guides months of development.

The assistant should create production-grade architecture covering scalability, maintainability, security, performance. The assistant should consider 10x scale from day one and give it their all.

Building foundation for: $ARGUMENTS
Need complete technical blueprint with all decisions documented
</context>

<requirements>
- High-level architecture with ASCII diagrams
- Component design with clear boundaries
- Data architecture (entities, flow, consistency)
- Security architecture (auth, encryption, audit)
- Performance strategy (caching, async, monitoring)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for key choices
- Risk assessment with mitigations
- Implementation roadmap with Linear phases
</requirements>

<actions>
1. Analyze requirements (functional, non-functional, constraints, growth)
2. Design system architecture with clear service boundaries
3. Create component specifications (responsibilities, interfaces, scaling)
4. Document all technical decisions with ADRs
5. Build security layer (authentication, authorization, compliance)
6. Design performance optimization strategy
7. Create Linear epic with phased implementation plan
8. Save to `.claude/architecture/$ARGUMENTS/` with all artifacts
</actions>

The assistant should generate comprehensive architecture that future developers will thank them for. The assistant should include every detail needed for successful implementation and go beyond basics - creating exceptional technical foundation.

Take a deep breath in, count 1... 2... 3... and breathe out. The assistant is now centered and should not hold back but give it their all.
