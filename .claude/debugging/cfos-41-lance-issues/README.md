# CFOS-41: Lance Map Type and Blob Filter Issues

This directory contains the investigation and solution documentation for CFOS-41, which initially appeared to be a Lance Map type incompatibility issue but turned out to be a more fundamental limitation with Lance's blob column scanning.

2. **LANCE_ISSUE_SOLUTION.md** - Initial solution thoughts
3. **COMPREHENSIVE_SOLUTIONS_ANALYSIS.md** - Detailed analysis of different approaches
4. **LANCE_BLOB_FILTER_BUG_ANALYSIS.md** - Deep dive into the Lance blob filtering issue
5. **LONG_TERM_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Long-term strategy for handling Lance limitations
6. **FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - The final implementation approach

## Key Findings

1. **Lance doesn't support Map type** - We must use `list<struct>` instead
2. **Lance can't scan blob-encoded columns** - This is the root cause of the panics
3. **Solution**: Automatically exclude blob columns from scanner projections when filters are used

## Implementation

The solution was implemented in `contextframe/frame.py`:
- Added `_get_non_blob_columns()` helper
- Modified `scanner()` to exclude blob columns when filtering
- Updated `from_arrow()` to handle missing fields gracefully

## Test Files

All tests were implemented in the standard location:
- `contextframe/tests/test_frameset.py` - Contains tests for frameset functionality
