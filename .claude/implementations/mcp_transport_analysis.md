# MCP Transport Layer Analysis: HTTP-First Architecture

## Overview

The ContextFrame MCP transport layer implements a sophisticated abstraction that enables seamless communication between MCP clients and servers across different transport mechanisms. The architecture prioritizes HTTP as the primary transport while maintaining full compatibility with stdio for CLI usage.

## Transport Architecture

### Core Abstraction

The transport layer is built on a clean abstraction defined in `contextframe/mcp/core/transport.py`:

```python
class TransportAdapter(ABC):
    """Base class for transport adapters.
    
    This abstraction ensures that all MCP features (tools, resources,
    subscriptions, etc.) work identically across different transports.
    """
```

Key abstract methods:
- `send_message()` / `receive_message()`: Core message passing
- `send_progress()`: Progress updates with transport-appropriate delivery
- `handle_subscription()`: Streaming changes based on transport capabilities
- `supports_streaming`: Capability detection for transport features

### Transport Implementations

#### 1. HTTP Transport (Primary)

The HTTP transport (`contextframe/mcp/transports/http/`) is the production-ready, scalable solution:

**Architecture:**
- **FastAPI-based server** with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **RESTful endpoints** wrapping JSON-RPC for convenience
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** for optional real-time streaming
- **Comprehensive security** including OAuth 2.1, CORS, and rate limiting

**Key Components:**
- `HttpAdapter`: Manages HTTP-specific features like SSE streams and operation tracking
- `MCPHTTPServer`: FastAPI application with all MCP endpoints
- `SSEManager`: Handles multiple concurrent SSE connections with lifecycle management
- `HTTPTransportConfig`: Extensive configuration options for production deployments

#### 2. Stdio Transport (CLI/Development)

The stdio transport (`contextframe/mcp/transports/stdio.py`) provides:
- JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout
- Buffered streaming for non-streaming environments
- Progress collection in responses
- Polling-based subscriptions

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. HTTP as Primary Transport

**Rationale:**
- **Scalability**: HTTP servers can handle thousands of concurrent connections
- **Security**: Mature security ecosystem (TLS, OAuth, CORS)
- **Interoperability**: Works with any HTTP client library
- **Monitoring**: Standard HTTP metrics and logging
- **Load Balancing**: Can deploy behind standard load balancers

**Benefits:**
- Production-ready from day one
- Native browser support
- Extensive tooling ecosystem
- Standard deployment patterns

### 2. SSE as Optional Enhancement

Server-Sent Events provide real-time streaming when needed:

```python
class HttpAdapter(TransportAdapter):
    """HTTP transport adapter with optional SSE streaming support.
    
    Note: HTTP with JSON responses is the primary transport method. SSE should
    only be used when real-time streaming is specifically required.
    """
```

**Use Cases:**
- Progress tracking for long-running operations
- Real-time dataset change notifications
- Streaming batch operation results

**Design Choice:** SSE is optional because:
- Most operations complete quickly (< 1 second)
- Polling is sufficient for many use cases
- Reduces complexity for simple integrations
- SSE connections consume server resources

### 3. REST Endpoints vs JSON-RPC

The implementation provides both:

**JSON-RPC Endpoint:**
```
POST /mcp/v1/jsonrpc
```

**Convenience REST Endpoints:**
```
POST /mcp/v1/initialize
GET  /mcp/v1/tools/list
POST /mcp/v1/tools/call
GET  /mcp/v1/resources/list
POST /mcp/v1/resources/read
```

**Rationale:**
- JSON-RPC for protocol compliance
- REST for developer ergonomics
- Both use the same underlying handlers
- Allows gradual migration

### 4. WebSocket Considerations

WebSockets were considered but not implemented because:
- SSE provides sufficient real-time capabilities
- Simpler client implementation (especially in browsers)
- Better compatibility with HTTP infrastructure
- Lower server resource usage
- Automatic reconnection support

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Tool Integration

Tools are transport-agnostic through the adapter pattern:

```python
class MessageHandler:
    def __init__(self, dataset: FrameDataset, adapter: TransportAdapter):
        self.adapter = adapter
        # Tools work identically regardless of transport
```

### 2. Progress Reporting

Transport-appropriate progress delivery:

```python
# HTTP: Real-time SSE streaming
async def send_progress(self, progress: Progress):
    if operation_id in self._operation_progress:
        await queue.put({
            "type": "progress",
            "data": {...}
        })

# Stdio: Buffered in response
async def send_progress(self, progress: Progress):
    self._current_progress.append(progress)
```

### 3. Error Propagation

Consistent error handling across transports:
- MCP protocol errors (JSON-RPC error codes)
- HTTP status codes for HTTP transport
- Detailed error messages in all cases

### 4. Request/Response Correlation

- **HTTP**: Natural request/response pairs
- **Stdio**: JSON-RPC id field for correlation
- **SSE**: Event IDs for stream correlation

## Performance and Scaling

### 1. Connection Management

```python
class SSEManager:
    def __init__(self, max_connections: int = 1000, max_age_seconds: int = 3600):
        # Automatic cleanup of old connections
        # Connection limits to prevent resource exhaustion
```

### 2. Request Pipelining

HTTP/2 support enables:
- Multiple concurrent requests
- Header compression
- Stream multiplexing
- Server push (future enhancement)

### 3. Load Balancing

Stateless design enables horizontal scaling:
- No server-side session state
- Operations tracked by ID
- Can deploy multiple instances
- Standard HTTP load balancers work

### 4. Resource Efficiency

```python
# Token bucket rate limiting
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, requests_per_minute: int = 60, burst: int = 10):
        # Prevents resource exhaustion
        # Fair resource allocation
```

## Configuration and Deployment

### 1. Comprehensive Configuration

```python
@dataclass
class HTTPTransportConfig:
    # Server settings
    host: str = "0.0.0.0"
    port: int = 8080
    
    # Security
    auth_enabled: bool = False
    cors_enabled: bool = True
    rate_limit_enabled: bool = True
    ssl_enabled: bool = False
    
    # Performance
    sse_max_connections: int = 1000
    max_request_size: int = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB
    request_timeout: int = 300  # 5 minutes
```

### 2. Environment Variable Support

```bash
# All settings configurable via environment
MCP_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0
MCP_HTTP_PORT=8080
MCP_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED=true
MCP_HTTP_AUTH_SECRET_KEY=your-secret
```

### 3. Production Features

- Health checks (`/health`, `/ready`)
- Prometheus metrics (`/metrics`)
- Structured logging
- Graceful shutdown
- Connection draining

## Client Implementation Guidance

### 1. Simple Operations (Recommended)

```python
# Use standard HTTP POST for most operations
response = await client.post("/mcp/v1/tools/call", json={
    "name": "search_documents",
    "arguments": {"query": "machine learning"}
})
```

### 2. Progress Tracking (When Needed)

```python
# Only use SSE for long-running operations
if response.headers.get("X-Operation-Id"):
    # Connect to SSE for progress
    async with sse_client(f"/mcp/v1/sse/progress/{operation_id}"):
        # Handle progress events
```

### 3. Change Subscriptions (Advanced)

```python
# SSE for real-time updates
eventSource = new EventSource("/mcp/v1/sse/subscribe?resource_type=documents")
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    // Handle changes
}
```

## Migration Path

### From Stdio to HTTP

1. **Minimal Changes**: Same tool names and arguments
2. **Transport Selection**: Command-line flag or config
3. **Gradual Migration**: Can run both transports simultaneously
4. **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes

### Example Migration

```bash
# Before (stdio)
python -m contextframe.mcp dataset.lance

# After (HTTP)
python -m contextframe.mcp dataset.lance --transport http --port 8080

# Both (transition period)
python -m contextframe.mcp dataset.lance --transport both --port 8080
```

## Production Deployment Patterns

### 1. Basic Deployment

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  mcp-server:
    image: contextframe/mcp-server
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - MCP_HTTP_PORT=8080
      - MCP_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED=true
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

### 2. High Availability
