# ContextFrame MCP Server

The ContextFrame Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides a standardized interface for AI agents and language models to interact with ContextFrame datasets. Built on the MCP specification, it enables seamless integration with any MCP-compatible client.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables seamless communication between AI models and external systems. ContextFrame's MCP server implements this protocol to provide:

- **Standardized Access**: Uniform interface for querying and managing document collections
- **Tool-based Interaction**: Rich set of tools for document operations, search, and analysis
- **Transport Flexibility**: Support for HTTP (primary) and stdio transports
- **Production Ready**: Built-in security, monitoring, and performance optimization

## Key Features

### ðŸ”§ Comprehensive Tool Suite

- **Document Operations**: Create, read, update, delete documents
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text, semantic, and hybrid search capabilities
- **Collection Management**: Organize documents into logical collections
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk operations with transactional support
- **Analytics**: Usage tracking, performance monitoring, and cost attribution

### ðŸ”’ Enterprise Security

- **Multi-Provider Authentication**: API keys, OAuth 2.1, JWT tokens
- **Fine-grained Authorization**: Role-based and resource-level access control
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse with configurable limits
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Track all operations for compliance

### ðŸ“Š Built-in Monitoring

- **Performance Metrics**: Track operation latency and throughput
- **Usage Analytics**: Monitor document and query patterns
- **Cost Attribution**: Calculate and track LLM operation costs
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Visualize system health and usage

### ðŸš€ Production Ready

- **HTTP-First Design**: RESTful API with optional SSE streaming
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Stateless design for easy scaling
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and detailed error messages
- **Extensive Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
